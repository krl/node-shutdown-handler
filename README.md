Node.js Shutdown Handler
========================

Creates the ability to execute code upon closing a Node.js application.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install shutdown-handler
```


## Usage

In order to simply execute code prior to closing the application, add an event listener for the `exit` event:

```node
require('shutdown-handler').on('exit', function() {
  console.log("Shutdown...");
});
```

By default however, the application gets automatically closed after the events have been triggered. In order to avoid this default behaviour, simply execute the `preventDefault` function on the passed event object:

```node
require('shutdown-handler').on('exit', function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  console.log("This application shall not be closed!");
});
```


## Windows CTRL+C behaviour

The original usage for this module was to immediately close the application when I were to press CTRL+C in my console. Usually the console then asks if I'm sure whether I want to stop the current batch and that kind of annoyed me. So, in case you're sharing my opinion about this, you may use this module in order to make CTRL+C work properly.
